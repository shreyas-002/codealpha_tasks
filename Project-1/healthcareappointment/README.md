## DocCare – Healthcare Appointment System

DocCare is a frontend-only healthcare appointment booking application built using **React** as part of the CodeAlpha internship tasks.

## 🧠 Appointment Logic

- Past dates are disabled using the HTML `min` attribute  
- Additional validation prevents booking invalid appointments  
- Appointment status is computed dynamically based on current date and time  
- Appointments are grouped by date in a calendar-style view
